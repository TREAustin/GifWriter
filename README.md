# GifWriter
A simple GIF creator in C#

For GIF Writer, I set out to make a simple application capable of converting sprite sheets into GIF's in the command line window. 

The main program takes 5 arguments from the command line.  The first being the image name.  The user only needs to know the relative path.  The main program 
determines the exact path.  The second argument is the output path for the GIF. The 3rd and 4th are the number of rows and columns.  The 5th is the number of repeats.
